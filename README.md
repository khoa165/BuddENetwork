# ***NOTES FOR GRADER***
- If you build a social network from scratch, then you have to start by adding a user first, and use the drop down or search field to set that user as central user, from then, you can start adding/removing friends and even adding other users, checking for mutual friends. If you attempt to add/remove friends or check for mutual buddies before creating any user, you will receive a warning that you need to set central user first.
- You can load file by placing it in the project directory and enter the file name, including the .txt extension. Multiple files can be loaded and data would be added to existing social network.
- If you want to navigate from one user to another user, please use drop down as it contains the a link or search field to set central user, clicking on central user's friends would not work.
