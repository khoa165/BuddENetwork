# BuddE Network project
#### Created by: Khoa Thien Le (Harry), Kenneth Mui, Shannon Stiles, Saniya Khullar.
#### UW-Madison, CS 400, A-Team 12.

#### ***Timeline:***
- November 18th:
  + Shannon initialized empty repository.
- November 25th:
  + Harry set up the project with JavaFX, created [.gitignore file](.gitignore), updated [README.md file](README.md).
  + Harry defined all exceptions required for Graph class (DuplicateUserException, DuplicateFrienshipException, IllegalNullArgumentException, UserNotFoundException, FriendshipNotFoundException).
- November 26th:
  + Harry defined all methods for Graph data structure in [GraphADT.java](application/GraphADT.java).
- November 29th:
  + Shannon cloned the repository to local workspace.
  + Shannon updated [User.java](application/User.java) to include name, and friend list.
  + Shannon created and set up [GraphTest.java](application/GraphTest.java).
  + Harry implemented all required methods for Graph data structure in [Graph.java](application/Graph.java).
  + Kenny cloned the repository to local workspace.
- November 30th:
  + Saniya cloned the repository to local workspace.
  + Shannon finished implementing a substantial great amount of tests for [GraphTest.java](application/GraphTest.java).
  + Harry defined all methods for SocialNetwork data structure in [SocialNetworkADT.java](application/SocialNetworkADT.java).
- December 1st:
  + Kenny implemented all required methods for Social Network in [SocialNetwork.java](application/SocialNetwork.java).
  + Shannon implemented code to structure the graphical components of the application.
  + Shannon implemented code to create static GUI to display navbar that show all the options for the user to interact with application, such as loading file and saving file, adding and removing users or friendships.
  + Saniya implemented code to create static GUI to visualize Mutual BuddEs between two users.
- December 2nd:
  + Kenny implemented code to create static GUI of social network that displays connections from central user to their friends.
  + Harry refactored Shannon's GUI code by breaking it down to methods.
- December 3rd:
  + Harry implemented code to load the social network from the file and generate graph dynamically.
  + Harry implemented code to shift graph to show corresponding friends when user sets new central user of the social network.
  + Saniya started implementing codes to test [SocialNetwork.java](application/SocialNetwork.java) in [SocialNetworkTest.java](application/SocialNetworkTest.java).
